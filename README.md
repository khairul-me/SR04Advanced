## Overview
The SR04Advanced library transforms the basic HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor into a highly accurate and reliable distance measurement system. By implementing sophisticated filtering algorithms and intelligent processing techniques, this library significantly improves measurement accuracy and stability compared to standard implementations.

## Why This Library?

Traditional HC-SR04 readings often suffer from:
- Noisy measurements
- Inconsistent readings
- Temperature-related inaccuracies
- Limited functionality
- Spike errors
- Poor performance in challenging environments

SR04Advanced solves these issues through:
- Advanced filtering techniques
- Temperature compensation
- Multiple measurement modes
- Real-time quality assessment
- Intelligent error detection
- Adaptive processing

## Key Innovations

### 1. Smart Filtering System
Our multi-layer filtering approach combines three powerful techniques:
- **Spike Removal**: Eliminates sudden, unrealistic changes in readings
- **Noise Reduction**: Smooths out measurement variations
- **Smart Tracking**: Predicts and validates measurements for optimal accuracy

### 2. Adaptive Measurement
The library automatically adjusts its behavior based on:
- Environmental conditions
- Required accuracy
- Speed requirements
- Signal quality

### 3. Temperature Compensation
Built-in temperature compensation ensures accurate measurements across different conditions:
- Automatically adjusts calculations based on temperature
- Compensates for speed of sound variations
- Provides consistent readings in varying environments

### 4. Quality Metrics
Real-time quality assessment helps you understand your data:
- Signal quality percentage
- Confidence levels
- Noise measurements
- Statistical analysis

## Real-World Applications

This library is ideal for:
- **Robotics**: Accurate obstacle detection and navigation
- **Automation**: Precise distance measurements for control systems
- **Monitoring**: Reliable level sensing and object detection
- **Educational Projects**: Advanced sensor processing demonstrations
- **Industrial Applications**: Robust distance measurement in varying conditions

SR04Advanced sonar(TRIGGER_PIN, ECHO_PIN);

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    sonar.begin();  // Initializes with auto-calibration
}

void loop() {
    float distance = sonar.getSmartDistance();

    Serial.print(distance);
    Serial.println(" cm");
    delay(100);

```cpp
#include <SR04Advanced.h>

SR04Advanced sonar(9, 10);

    Serial.begin(9600);
    
    // Advanced configuration
    sonar.setDebugLevel(DEBUG_ADVANCED);
    sonar.setMeasurementMode(SR04Advanced::MODE_PRECISE);
    sonar.setFilterParams(0.1, 5);  // Alpha, window size
    sonar.setTemperature(25.0);     // Ambient temperature in Celsius
    
    sonar.begin(true);  // true = perform auto-calibration
    sonar.enablePlotter(true);  // Enable data visualization
}

void loop() {
    float distance = sonar.getSmartDistance();
    uint8_t quality = sonar.getSignalQuality();
    uint8_t confidence = sonar.getConfidence();
    
    Serial.print("Distance: ");
    Serial.print(distance);
    Serial.print(" cm | Quality: ");
    Serial.print(quality);
    Serial.print("% | Confidence: ");
